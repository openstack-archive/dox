Sometime there is some ideas that are just obvious that they are good
ideas. When Monty
[[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cloud.openstack.devel/34675][started to
mention]] on the OpenStack development mailing
list about a tool allowing to integrate docker containers to do the
testing it was obvious it was those ideas that everybody was thinking
about that it would be awesome if it was implemented and started to
get used.

The idea of dox is like the name imply is to slightly behave like
the [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox][tox]] tool but instead of running different virtualenvs you are
using docker containers.

The testing in the OpenStack world is a bit different than the other
unit testing. Since OpenStack is inherently working with the local
system components we have to get abstracted from the local developer
box to match exactly the system components. In other words if we run
testing against a zookeeper daemon of a specific version we want to
make it sure and easy that this version has been installed.

And that's where [[http://docker.io/][docker]] can help, since you can easily specify
different images and how to build them making sure we have those tools
installed when we run our testing targets.

There is other issues with tox we have encountered in our extensive
use of it in the OpenStack world we are hoping to solve
here. virtualenv has been slow for us and we have come up with all
sorts of hacks to get around it. And as monty mention in his mailing
list post docker itself does an EXCELLENT job at handling caching and
reuse where we easily see in the future those standard image built by
the openstack-infra folks that we know works and validated in upstream
openstack-ci published on [[https://registry.hub.docker.com/][dockerhub]] that
everyone else (and dox) can use to run tests.

The tool is available here in
[[http://ci.openstack.org/stackforge.html][stackfoge]] here :

https://git.openstack.org/cgit/stackforge/dox

Its not quite ready yet but you can start running tests using it. If
you want a fun project to work on that can help the whole Python
development community (and not just OpenStack) come hack with us.
